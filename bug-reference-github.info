**********************

Automatically set `bug-reference-url-format' and enable
`bug-reference-prog-mode' buffers from Github repositories.

   What it does is:

  1. If `bug-reference-url-format' is not set and this appears to be
     part of a git working copy (we can locate a .git/config).

  2. Find the git remote repository (run `git ls-remote --get-url').

  3. If the remote matches github.com set `bug-reference-url-format' to
     the correct Github issue URL (we set it buffer locally).

  4. Enable `bug-reference-prog-mode'.
